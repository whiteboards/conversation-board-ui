// This file is imported at the top of our application.

// I think this one file will be sufficient to handle the styling tweaks we need. If
// we ever need more, we need to @import those files here rather than importing
// straight into the ts files.

// The way webpack pulls in imported scss files is done in such a way that the styles
// get pulled in as global styles. It isn't smart enough to quarantine them to the
// component where they were imported. This is why we need to @import here, so we can
// handle style nesting correctly.
